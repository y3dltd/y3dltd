👋 Hi, I’m @y3dltd (Jayson)
👀 I’m interested in 3D printing, CAD design, digital fabrication, and open‑source hardware.
🌱 I’m currently learning generative design workflows, VR/AR integration for prototypes, and advanced slicing techniques.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sustainable 3D printing initiatives, community workshops, and open‑source slicer development.
